Issues that we've enncountered:

1. Utilizing Github Collab effectively
2. Finding the correct Geometry for the widgets
3. Connecting the buttons to their respective functions


Solutions to those issues:

1. We communicated with each other and read github documentation.
2. Used QT Designer to make a mock of some of the features that would be implemented and finding the coordinates that looked best
3. Looked at PyQT documentation and found the function to link the two
